Upon viewing the theme, what the following was identified: 
* Missing a stylesheet
* Inline CSS flipping the site 180 Degrees
* A large blank space between the header and the products on Category Pages with Product Filters

My first step to engage with this was to load the site (localhost:3000) was to view my JavaScript Console. I was using Google Chrome, and so I used "Inspect." In the console, I found 422 errors, which is not particularly verbose, or rather, it does not really point us in the right direction. From there, I attempted to find what was flipping the site. Because the entire site's CSS was missing besides these elements, this pointed me to look into Inline-CSS, or CSS within HTML/template files. These are commonly added to the header and footer files. 

From here, I viewed the page source. I found first that a lot of the expected header information was missing, but no CSS. Once I scrolled to the bottom, I located the following code: 

*/       <style>
            body {
           width: 100%;
           height: 100%;
           -moz-transform: rotate(180deg);
           -webkit-transform: rotate(180deg);
           -ms-transform: rotate(180deg);
           -o-transform: rotate(180deg);
           transform: rotate(180deg);
        }
        </style>
        
 From here, I located the file, using XCode, which is under Templates > Components > Common > Footer.html, and removed the code. (Lines 92-102) 
 
 Next, I move to engage with the missing stylesheet. I have a feeling like it has to do with the header as I noted, but the Header file in that templates directory is normal. I then moved to look at Stencil CLI, which was running the site, and saw an error denoting that the file does not exist. When I navigated to the directory, I found that was absolutely correct, and so I copied over the example header from the most recent version of Cornerstone. From there, the stylesheet remained missing; however, the error in Stencil changed to "Error: no mixin names lazy-loaded-img", which noted line 168 as the corresponding space:
 
 { Error: no mixin named lazy-loaded-img

Backtrace:
	layouts/header/header.scss:168
    at options.error (/Users/lukesteiner/.nvm/versions/node/v6.4.0/lib/node_modules/@bigcommerce/stencil-cli/node_modules/@bigcommerce/node-sass/lib/index.js:277:32)
  formatted: 'Error: no mixin named lazy-loaded-img\n\n       Backtrace:\n       \tlayouts/header/header.scss:168\n        on line 168 of layouts/header/header.scss\n>>     @include lazy-loaded-img;\n   -------------^\n',
  message: 'no mixin named lazy-loaded-img\n\nBacktrace:\n\tlayouts/header/header.scss:168',
  column: 14,
  line: 168,
  file: 'layouts/header/header.scss',
  status: 1 >
  
Notice, it back traced to the file layouts/header/header.scss, and so when I move to the directory Assets > scss > layouts > header > header.scss, and edited the file. Upon removing line 168, which notes a call to load lazy-loaded-img (which doesn't exist) the stylesheet was applied to the site.
 
 Finally, upon visiting my example category page, I could see the large white space where a carousel would show on the homepage. From here Stencil is no longer throwing errors, the console and page source aren't wholly helpful, and the issue still appears to be CSS/styling related. With that in mind, I moved back to the Inspect tool, and used the "Inspect Element" cursor to select CSS. When I selected the full space, there were a few styles that were being applied, from classes such as container and body. Body stuck out to me, as the description for that file, from the file is as follows: 
 
 "Header is fixed on small screens use the content body to create the white space between it and the header on all situations." 
 
 Upon opening this file, under Assets > scss > layouts > body > _body.scss, I was able to see that the syntax was all "greyed," which indicates that it is commented out. This basically means that there are symbols before and/or after that are breaking the syntax, so that it does not run. By removing the */ from the front, and /* from the back, I fixed the syntax, and the white space was cleared. 

Moving forward, feel free to download this version of the theme, or make the changes I noted above. If you wish to be walked through how I troubleshooted this, and how I used the tools noted here, please come to my training with your peers on 5/10, in Missile Command, at 11AM.

# Cornerstone
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bigcommerce/cornerstone.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bigcommerce/cornerstone)

Stencil's Cornerstone theme is the building block for BigCommerce theme developers to get started quickly developing premium quality themes on the BigCommerce platform.

### Stencil Utils
[Stencil-utils](https://github.com/bigcommerce/stencil-utils) is our supporting library for our events and remote interactions.

## JS API
When writing theme JavaScript (JS) there is an API in place for running JS on a per page basis. To properly write JS for your theme, the following page types are available to you:

* "pages/account/addresses"
* "pages/account/add-address"
* "pages/account/add-return"
* "pages/account/add-wishlist"
* "pages/account/recent-items"
* "pages/account/download-item"
* "pages/account/edit"
* "pages/account/return-saved"
* "pages/account/returns"
* "pages/auth/login"
* "pages/auth/account-created"
* "pages/auth/create-account"
* "pages/auth/new-password"
* "pages/blog"
* "pages/blog-post"
* "pages/brand"
* "pages/brands"
* "pages/cart"
* "pages/category"
* "pages/compare"
* "pages/errors"
* "pages/gift-certificate/purchase"
* "pages/gift-certificate/balance"
* "pages/gift-certificate/redeem"
* "global"
* "pages/home"
* "pages/order-complete"
* "pages/page"
* "pages/product"
* "pages/search"
* "pages/sitemap"
* "pages/subscribed"
* "page/account/wishlist-details"
* "pages/account/wishlists"

These page types will correspond to the pages within your theme. Each one of these page types map to an ES6 module that extends the base `PageManager` abstract class.

```javascript
    export default class Auth extends PageManager {
        constructor() {
            // Set up code goes here; attach to internals and use internals as you would 'this'
        }
    }
```

Within `PageManager` you will see methods that are available from all classes, but there are three really important methods. The following methods have the signature `func (callback)` and the callback takes `callback(err)` if there is an error.

#### before(callback)
When this method is implemented in your class, the code contained therein will be executed after the constructor but before the `loaded()` method. This provides a shim for your code before your main implementation logic runs.

```javascript
    export default class Auth extends PageManager {
        constructor() {
            // Set up code goes here
        }
        before(callback) {
            // Code that should be run before any other code in this class

            // Callback must be called to move on to the next method
            callback();
        }
    }
```

#### loaded(callback)
This method will be called when the constructor has run and `before()` has been executed. Main implementation code should live in the loaded method.

```javascript
    export default class Auth extends PageManager {
        constructor() {
            // Set up code goes here
        }
        loaded(callback) {
            // Main implementation logic here

            // Callback must be called to move on to the next method
            callback();
        }
    }
```

#### after(callback)
This method is for any cleanup that may need to happen and it will be executed after `before()` and `loaded()`.

```javascript
    export default class Auth extends PageManager {
        constructor() {
            // Set up code goes here
        }
        after(callback) {
            // Main implementation logic here

            // Callback must be called to move on to the next method
            callback();
        }
    }
```

### JS Template Context Injection
Occasionally you may need to use dynamic data from the template context within your client-side theme application code.

Two helpers are provided to help achieve this.

The inject helper allows you to compose a JSON object with a subset of the template context to be sent to the browser.

```
{{inject "stringBasedKey" contextValue}}
```

To retrieve the parsable JSON object, just call `{{jsContext}}` after all of the `{{@inject}}` calls.

For example, to setup the product name in your client-side app, you can do the following if you're in the context of a product:

```html
{{inject "myProductName" product.title}}

<script>
// Note the lack of quotes around the jsContext handlebars helper, it becomes a string automatically.
var jsContext = JSON.parse({{jsContext}}); // jsContext would output "{\"myProductName\": \"Sample Product\"}" which can feed directly into your JavaScript

console.log(jsContext.myProductName); // Will output: Sample Product
</script>
```

You can compose your JSON object across multiple pages to create a different set of client-side data depending on the currently loaded template context.

The stencil theme makes the jsContext available on both the active page scoped and global PageManager objects as `this.context`.


## Static assets
Some static assets in the Stencil theme are handled with Grunt if required. This
means you have some dependencies on grunt and npm. To get started:

First make sure you have Grunt installed globally on your machine:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

and run:

```
npm install
```

### Icons
Icons are delivered via a single SVG sprite, which is embedded on the page in
`templates/layout/base.html`. It is generated via a grunt task `grunt svgstore`.

The task takes individual SVG files for each icon in `assets/icons` and bundles
them together, to be inlined on the top of the theme, inside a handlebars partial.
Each icon can then be called in a similar way to an inline image via:

```
<svg><use xlink:href="#icon-svgFileName" /></svg>
```

The ID of the SVG icon you are calling is based on the filename of the icon you want,
with `icon-` prepended. e.g. `xlink:href="#icon-facebook"`.

Simply add your new icon SVG file to the icons folder, and run `grunt svgstore`,
or just `grunt`.
